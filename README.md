# Dynamics of electrical machines and drives project 2024
## Direct Torque Control

In this report you can find my project for the **Dynamics of electrical machines and drives** course held by the professor **Francesco Castelli Dezza** at the **Politecnico di Milano** for the master's degree in **Automation engineering**.

In the project I provide an implementation of **Direct Torque Control**.

## Repo structure

- `report` folder contains the source code in Latex to build the report
- `models` folder contains all the simulink models and matlab script using during the project
  - `DEMDlib.slx` is a simulink library totally created by my self implementing all component needed to work with inductive motors and **Direct Torque Control**

## Report PDF
